# Astr501

There will be folders for each week so just add your notebooks to the appropriate week. You can use this repo to store a copy that won't be "randomly" deleted like the notebooks stored on astrohub. You can also easily clone this repo (containing yours as well as others notebooks) to astrohub by using the command:

`git clone https://github.com/David-Stephens/Astr501`

in the terminal running on <https://astrohub.uvic.ca/>
