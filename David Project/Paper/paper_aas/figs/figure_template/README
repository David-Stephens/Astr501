run example notebook in a jupyter session:

We place in this location not only the figure itself but also the
ipython notebook of plotting script and other information were used to
make the figure. If the data is relevant enough to be shown in a paper
it should be uploaded and stored on the CADC server. Then, the
plotting script should plot directly from the CADC server, which
ensures that other NuGrid members can reproduce the plots. The python
script that makes the plot should also contain the figure caption as a
comment at the beginning.  There is an example_figure.ipnb in this
directory to demonstrate this. Each figure can have its own directory
in the figs directory. The python file should also contain
instructions how exactly the python script should be used in order to
produce the plot.
