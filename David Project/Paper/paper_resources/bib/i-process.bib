	Covariances, Fission Product Yields and Decay Data},
  journal = {Nuclear Data Sheets},
  year = {2011},
  volume = {112},

  month = dec,
  abstract = {The {ENDF/B-VII.1} library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear
	data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications,
	and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release
	of {ENDF/B-VII.0.} These advances focus on neutron cross sections,
	covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent
	work by the {US} Cross Section Evaluation Working Group {(CSEWG)}
	in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear
	theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment.
	
	The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in
	the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending
	from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data
	for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion
	papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions
	on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance
	parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy
	reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5)
	Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes
	of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials
	{(Cd}, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes
	of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides
	{235,238U} and {239Pu} at this point, except for delayed neutron
	data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after
	a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption
	of {JENDL-4.0} evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and
	some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations;
	(8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons
	and 14 {MeV} neutrons incident on {239Pu;} and (9) A new decay data
	sublibrary.
	
	Integral validation testing of the {ENDF/B-VII.1} library is provided
	for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the {VII.1}
	library maintains the generally-good performance seen for {VII.0}
	for a wide range of {MCNP} simulations of criticality benchmarks,
	with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations,
	especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements
	although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent.
	Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons
	of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies
	and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged
	capture cross sections at 30 {keV} are also provided for astrophysics
	applications.
	
	We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for
	{ENDF/B-VII.1} and the measured data and calculations that motivated
	the changes, and therefore this paper augments the {ENDF/B-VII.0}

  abstract = {The fourth version of the Japanese Evaluated Nuclear Data Library
	has been produced in cooperation with the Japanese Nuclear Data Committee.
	In the new library, much emphasis is placed on the improvements of
	fission product and minor actinoid data. Two nuclear model codes
	were developed in order to evaluate the cross sections of fission
	products and minor actinoids. Coupled-channel optical model parameters,
	which can be applied to wide mass and energy regions, were obtained
	for nuclear model calculations. Thermal cross sections of actinoids
	were carefully examined by considering experimental data or by the
	systematics of neighboring nuclei. Most of the fission cross sections
	were derived from experimental data. A simultaneous evaluation was
	performed for the fission cross sections of important uranium and
	plutonium isotopes above 10 {keV.} New evaluations were performed
	for the thirty fissionproduct nuclides that had not been contained
	in the previous library {JENDL-3.3.} The data for light elements
	and structural materials were partly reevaluated. Moreover, covariances
	were estimated mainly for actinoids. The new library was released
