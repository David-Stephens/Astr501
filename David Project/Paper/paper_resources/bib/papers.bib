abstract = {Mass transfer in close binaries significantly alters the evolution of both stellar components. Depending on the system parameters and the donor's radius, mass transfer can be dynamically unstable and lead to runaway evolution. Until recently, the standard picture was that giant stars, having convective envelopes, expand when they lose mass, in which case mass transfer is in most cases unstable. This description is not accurate as it is based on invalid assumptions. Based on one-dimensional simulations for donors on both the red and the asymptotic giant branches, with mass loss rates going from $10^{-3}$ up to 2\msun/yr, we show that in the case of dynamical timescale mass loss, the evolution of mass-losing giant stars is not adiabatic. The superadiabatic outer layer of the giant's envelope has a local thermal timescale comparable to the dynamical timescale induced by mass loss. Therefore, this layer has enough time to readjust. Moreover, the giant star is driven out of hydrostatic equilibrium and energy can now be stored into its kinetic form. As a result, we show that giant donors, in most cases, do not expand. If the mass loss rate is high enough, the superadiabacity of the outer layer is lost progressively and a radiative zone forms due to a combination of thermal readjustment and dynamical effects mentioned above.},

abstract = {The contribution by massive stars (M > 9 solar masses) to the weak s-process component of the solar system abundances is primarily due to the 22Ne neutron source, which is activated near the end of helium-core burning. The residual 22Ne left over from helium-core burning is then reignited during carbon burning, initiating further s-processing that modifies the isotopic distribution. This modification is sensitive to the stellar structure and the carbon burning reaction rate. Recent work on the 12C + 12C reaction suggests that resonances located within the Gamow peak may exist, causing a strong increase in the astrophysical S-factor and consequently the reaction rate. To investigate the effect of an increased rate, 25 solar mass stellar models with three different carbon burning rates, at solar metallicity, were generated using the Geneva Stellar Evolution Code (GENEC) with nucleosynthesis post-processing calculated using the NuGrid Multi-zone Post-Processing Network code (MPPNP). The strongest rate caused carbon burning to occur in a large convective core rather than a radiative one. The presence of this large convective core leads to an overlap with the subsequent convective carbon-shell, significantly altering the initial composition of the carbon-shell. In addition, an enhanced rate causes carbon-shell burning episodes to ignite earlier in the evolution of the star, igniting the 22Ne source at lower temperatures and reducing the neutron density.},

abstract = {Simulations of nucleosynthesis in astrophysical environments are at the intersection of nuclear physics reaction rate research and astrophysical applications, for example in the area of galactic chemical evolution or near-field cosmology. Unfortunately, at present the available yields for such applications are based on heterogeneous assumptions between the various contributing nuclear production sites, both in terms of modeling the thermodynamic environment itself as well as the choice of specifc nuclear reaction rates and compilations. On the other side, new nuclear reaction rate determinations are often taking a long time to be included in astrophysical applications. The NuGrid project addresses these issues by providing a set of codes and a framework in which these codes interact. In this contribution we describe the motivation, goals and first results of the NuGrid project. At the core is a new and evolving post-processing nuclesoynthesis code (PPN) that can follow quiescent and explosive nucleosynthesis following multi-zone 1D-stellar evolution as well as multi-zone hydrodynamic input, including explosions. First results are available in the areas of AGB and massive stars.},

abstract = {The cosmic dispersion in the abundances of the heavy elements strontium and barium in halo stars is well known. Strontium and barium are detected in most cool, metal-poor giants, but are these elements always detectable? To identify stars that could be considered probable candidates for lacking these elements, I examine the stellar abundance data available in the literature for 1148 field stars and 226 stars in dwarf galaxies, 776 of which have metallicities lower than [Fe/H]<-2.0. Strontium or barium have been detected in all field, globular cluster, and dwarf galaxy environments studied. All upper limits are consistent with the lowest detected ratios of [Sr/H] and [Ba/H]. The frequent appearance of these elements raises the intriguing prospect that at least one kind of neutron-capture reaction operates as often as the nucleosynthesis mechanisms that produce lighter elements, like magnesium, calcium, or iron, although the yields of heavy elements may be more variable.},

abstract = {We present the first hydrodynamic, multidimensional simulations of He shell flash convection. We investigate the properties of shell convection immediately before the He luminosity peak during the 15th thermal pulse of a stellar evolution track with initially 2 solar masses and metallicity Z=0.01. This choice is a representative example of a low-mass asymptotic giant branch thermal pulse. We construct the initial vertical stratification with a set of polytropes to resemble the stellar evolution structure. Convection is driven by a constant volume heating in a thin layer at the bottom of the unstable layer. We calculate a grid of two-dimensional simulations with different resolutions and heating rates, plus one low-resolution three-dimensional run. The flow field is dominated by large convective cells that are centered in the lower half of the convection zone. It generates a rich spectrum of gravity waves in the stable layers both above and beneath the convective shell. The magnitude of the convective velocities from our one-dimensional mixing-length theory model and the rms-averaged vertical velocities from the hydrodynamic model are consistent within a factor of a few. However, the velocity profile in the hydrodynamic simulation is more asymmetric and decays exponentially inside the convection zone. Both g-modes and convective motions cross the formal convective boundaries, which leads to mixing across the boundaries. Our resolution study shows consistent flow structures among the higher resolution runs, and we see indications for convergence of the vertical velocity profile inside the convection zone for the highest resolution simulations. Many of the convective properties, in particular the exponential decay of the velocities, depend only weakly on the heating rate. However, the amplitudes of the gravity waves increase with both the heating rate and the resolution.},

abstract = {Calculations that demonstrate the influence of three key nuclear reaction rates on the evolution of asymptotic giant branch stars have been carried out. We study the case of a star with an initial mass of 2M{\&}sun; and a metallicity of Z=0.01, somewhat less than the solar metallicity. The dredge-up of nuclear processed material from the interior of the star and the yield predictions for carbon are sensitive to the rate of the 14N(p,$\gamma$)15O and triple-$\alpha$ reactions. These reactions dominate the H- and He-burning shells of stars in this late evolutionary phase. Published uncertainty estimates for each of these two rates propagated through stellar evolution calculations cause uncertainties in carbon enrichment and yield predictions of about a factor of 2. The other important He-burning reaction, 12C($\alpha$,$\gamma$)16O, although associated with the largest uncertainty in our study, does not have a significant influence on the abundance evolution compared with other modeling uncertainties. This finding remains valid when the entire evolution from the main sequence to the tip of the asymptotic giant branch is considered. We discuss the experimental sources of the rate uncertainties addressed here and give some outlooks for future work.},

abstract = {Depending on mass and metallicity as well as evolutionary phase, stars occasionally experience convective-reactive nucleosynthesis episodes. We specifically investigate the situation when nucleosynthetically unprocessed, H-rich material is convectively mixed with an He-burning zone, for example in a convectively unstable shell on top of electron-degenerate cores in asymptotic giant branch stars, young white dwarfs, or X-ray bursting neutron stars. Such episodes are frequently encountered in stellar evolution models of stars of extremely low or zero metal content, such as the first stars. We have carried out detailed nucleosynthesis simulations based on stellar evolution models and informed by hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on the convective-reactive episode in the very late thermal pulse star Sakurai's object (V4334 Sagittarii). Asplund et al. determined the abundances of 28 elements, many of which are highly non-solar, ranging from H, He, and Li all the way to Ba and La, plus the C isotopic ratio. Our simulations show that the mixing evolution according to standard, one-dimensional stellar evolution models implies neutron densities in the He intershell (lsim few 1011 cm-3) that are too low to obtain a significant neutron capture nucleosynthesis on the heavy elements. We have carried out three-dimensional hydrodynamic He-shell flash convection simulations in 4$\pi$ geometry to study the entrainment of H-rich material. Guided by these simulations we assume that the ingestion process of H into the He-shell convection zone leads only after some delay time to a sufficient entropy barrier that splits the convection zone into the original one driven by He burning and a new one driven by the rapid burning of ingested H. By making such mixing assumptions that are motivated by our hydrodynamic simulations we obtain significantly higher neutron densities (~ few 1015 cm-3) and reproduce the key observed abundance trends found in Sakurai's object. These include an overproduction of Rb, Sr, and Y by about two orders of magnitude higher than the overproduction of Ba and La. Such a peculiar nucleosynthesis signature is impossible to obtain with the mixing predictions in our one-dimensional stellar evolution models. The simulated Li abundance and the isotopic ratio 12C/13C are as well in agreement with observations. Details of the observed heavy element abundances can be used as a sensitive diagnostic tool for the neutron density, for the neutron exposure and, in general, for the physics of the convective-reactive phases in stellar evolution. For example, the high elemental ratio Sc/Ca and the high Sc production indicate high neutron densities. The diagnostic value of such abundance markers depends on uncertain nuclear physics input. We determine how our results depend on uncertainties of nuclear reaction rates, for example for the 13C($\alpha$, n)16O reaction.},

In this contect new models of the AGB stellar evolution phase at very low and zero metallicity are presented. Due to the deficiency or absence of CNO catalytic material hydrogen burning operates at significantly higher temperatures than in stars of higher metallicity. As a result convective mixing plays a very important role since the nuclear burning shells are not well separated by an entropy barrier. These stars can host flash-like burning events induced by mixing of C12 and protons at the core-envelope interface. Three different mixing events with proton-capture nucleosynthesis can be encountered. One of them, the hot dredge-up, is reported here for the first time. All these specific modes of nucleosynthesis are relevant for the production of CNO material in the first intermediate mass stars.},

We first compare the results obtained using two different numerical techniques with different resolutions, and find very good agreement overall. We then compare the outcomes of those simulations with observed systems thought to have gone through a CE. The simulations fail to reproduce those systems in the sense that most of the envelope of the donor remains bound at the end of the simulations and the final orbital separations between the donor's remnant and the companion, ranging from 26.8 down to 5.9 R {\&}sun;, are larger than the ones observed. We suggest that this discrepancy vouches for recombination playing an essential role in the ejection of the envelope and/or significant shrinkage of the orbit happening in the subsequent phase.},

abstract = {Recently improved information on the stellar (n, $\gamma$) cross sections of neutron magic nuclei at N=82, and in particular of 142Nd, turn out to represent a sensitive test for models of s-process nucleosynthesis. While these data were found to be incompatible with the classical approach based on an exponential distribution of neutron exposures, they provide significantly better agreement between the solar abundance distribution of s nuclei and the predictions of models for low-mass asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. The origin of this phenomenon is identified as lying in the high neutron exposures at low neutron density obtained between thermal pulses when 13C burns radiatively in a narrow layer of a few 10-4 Msolar. This effect is studied in some detail, and the influence of the currently available nuclear physics data is discussed with respect to specific further questions. In this context, particular attention is paid to a consistent description of s-process branchings in the region of the rare earth elements. It is shown that, in certain cases, the nuclear data are sufficiently accurate that the resulting abundance uncertainties can be completely attributed to stellar modeling. Thus, the s-process becomes important for testing the role of different stellar masses and metallicities as well as for constraining the assumptions used in describing the low neutron density provided by the 13C source.},

abstract = {We numerically investigate whether and how gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be converted into new stars within originally massive star clusters (MSCs) in order to understand the origin of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs). We adopt a scenario in which (i) MSCs with masses of Ms can be formed from high-mass, high-density giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in their host galactic building blocks embedded in dark matter haloes at high redshifts, and (ii) their evolution therefore can be significantly influenced by Ms, their initial locations and physical properties of their hosts. Our 3D hydrodynamical simulations show that gaseous ejecta from AGB stars can be retained within MSCs and consequently converted into new stars very efficiently in the central regions of MSCs, only if Ms exceeds a threshold mass (Mth) of ≈106 Msun. The new stars can correspond to the 'second generation (SG)' of stars with higher Na and lower O abundances observed in GCs. Star formation efficiencies during the formation of SG stars within MSCs with Ms≥Mth can be rather high (0.3-0.9) so that very compact new clusters within original MSCs can be formed. Ms should be as large as 106-107 Msun to explain the observed large fraction of SG stars in the present ordinary Galactic GCs, because new stars can consist of only 1-4 per cent among all stars for the standard initial mass function. Nuclear MSCs are found to retain much more effectively the AGB ejecta and convert more efficiently the gas into new stars, owing to the much deeper gravitational potential of their hosts. Capture and accretion of cold molecular gas (or small GMCs) by forming MSCs themselves can be mechanisms for mixing (i.e., dilution) of AGB ejecta with cold pristine gas. We suggest that both Ms and their locations within their hosts can determine whether abundance spread can be seen only in light elements or even in heavy ones. We discuss how and in what time-scale MSCs preferentially lose old stars owing to tidal stripping by their host galactic building blocks. We also suggest that the origin of the intermediate-age GCs with possible age spread of ˜100 Myr yet apparently no/little abundance spread in light elements in the LMC is closely associated with their incapability to retain the AGB ejecta owing to their low masses.},

abstract = {Using a new physical model for star formation, we have tested the possibility that globular clusters (GCs) are formed from primordial mass fluctuations, the mass scale of which (10\^8-10\^9 Msolar) is selected out of a cold dark matter spectrum by the mechanism of non-equilibrium formation of H\_2. We show that such clouds are able to convert about 0.002 of their total mass into a bound system (a GC) and about 0.02 into halo stars. The metal-enriched gas is dispersed from the GC by supernova explosions and forms the Galactic disc. The mass ratios between GCs, halo and disc depend on the predicted initial mass function which is a consequence of the universal statistics of fluid turbulence. They also depend on the ratio of baryonic to non-baryonic mass, X\_b, and are comparable to the values observed in typical spiral galaxies for X\_b\~0.1-0.2. The computed mass and radius for a GC (5x10\^5 Msolar and 30 pc) are in good agreement with the average values in the Galaxy. The model predicts an exponential cut-off in the stellar initial mass function below 0.2 Msolar in GCs and 0.7 Msolar in the halo. The reasonably massive star formation in primordial clouds leads to a large number of supernovae and to a high blue luminosity during the first 2 Gyr of the life of the Galaxy.},

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations in order to study the effects of supernova (SN) feedback on the formation of a Milky Way-type galaxy of virial mass ~10^12 M_sun/h. We analyse a set of simulations run with the code described by Scannapieco et al. (2005, 2006), where we have tested our star formation and feedback prescription using isolated galaxy models. Here we extend this work by simulating the formation of a galaxy in its proper cosmological framework, focusing on the ability of the model to form a disk-like structure in rotational support. We find that SN feedback plays a fundamental role in the evolution of the simulated galaxy, efficiently regulating the star formation activity, pressurizing the gas and generating mass-loaded galactic winds. These processes affect several galactic properties such as final stellar mass, morphology, angular momentum, chemical properties, and final gas and baryon fractions. In particular, we find that our model is able to reproduce extended disk components with high specific angular momentum and a significant fraction of young stars. The galaxies are also found to have significant spheroids composed almost entirely of stars formed at early times. We find that most combinations of the input parameters yield disk-like components, although with different sizes and thicknesses, indicating that the code can form disks without fine-tuning the implemented physics. We also show how our model scales to smaller systems. By analysing simulations of virial masses 10^9 M_sun/h and 10^10 M_sun/h, we find that the smaller the galaxy, the stronger the SN feedback effects.},

abstract = {We have obtained high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra for six red giants in $\omega$ Centauri: three belong to the recently discovered metal-rich red giant branch (RGB-a as defined by Pancino et al.) and three to the metal-intermediate population (RGB-MInt). Accurate iron, copper, and $\alpha$-element (Ca and Si) abundances have been derived and discussed. In particular, we have obtained the first direct abundance determination based on high-resolution spectroscopy for the RGB-a population, <[Fe/H]>=-0.60+/-0.15. Although this value is lower than previous estimates based on calcium triplet measurements, we confirm that this population is the most metal-rich in $\omega$ Cen. In addition, we have found a significant difference in the $\alpha$-element enhancement of the two populations. The three RGB-MInt stars have the expected overabundance, typical of halo and globular cluster stars: <[$\alpha$/Fe]>=0.29+/-0.01. The three RGB-a stars show, instead, a significantly lower $\alpha$-enhancement: <[$\alpha$/Fe]>=0.10+/-0.04. We have also detected an increasing trend of [Cu/Fe] with metallicity, similar to the one observed for field stars by Sneden et al. The observational facts presented in this Letter, if confirmed by larger samples of giants, are the first indication that supernovae Type Ia ejecta have contaminated the medium from which the metal-rich RGB-a stars have formed. The implications for current scenarios on the formation and evolution of $\omega$ Cen are briefly discussed. Based on Ultraviolet-Visual Echelle Spectrograph observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Paranal, Chile, within the observing program 165.L-0263.

abstract = {The globular cluster system of a typical spheroidal galaxy makes up about 0.25% of the total galaxy mass. This is roughly the same mass fraction as contained in the nuclear star cluster (or stellar nucleus) present in most nearby low-mass galaxies. Motivated by this ``coincidence,'' this Letter discusses a scenario in which globular clusters of present-day galaxies are the surviving nuclei of the dwarf galaxies that-according to the hierarchical merging paradigm of galaxy formation-constitute the ``building blocks'' of present-day massive galaxies. This scenario, which was first suggested by Freeman, has become more attractive recently in light of studies that demonstrate a complex star formation history in a number of massive globular clusters.},

abstract = {The $\alpha$ formalism is a common way to parametrize the common envelope interaction between a giant star and a more compact companion. The $\alpha$ parameter describes the fraction of orbital energy released by the companion that is available to eject the giant star's envelope. By using new, detailed stellar evolutionary calculations, we derive a user-friendly prescription for the $\lambda$ parameter and an improved approximation for the envelope binding energy, thus revising the $\alpha$ equation. We then determine $\alpha$ both from simulations and from observations in a self-consistent manner. By using our own stellar structure models as well as population considerations to reconstruct the primary's parameters at the time of the common envelope interaction, we gain a deeper understanding of the uncertainties. We find that systems with very low values of q (the ratio of the companion's mass to the mass of the primary at the time of the common envelope interaction) have higher values of $\alpha$. A fit to the data suggests that lower-mass companions are left at comparable or larger orbital separations to more massive companions. We conjecture that lower-mass companions take longer than a stellar dynamical time to spiral into the giant's core, and that this is key to allowing the giant to use its own thermal energy to help unbind its envelope. As a result, although systems with light companions might not have enough orbital energy to unbind the common envelope, they might stimulate a stellar reaction that results in the common envelope ejection.},

abstract = {We show that canonical extra mixing with a diffusion coefficient Dmix~109 cm2 s-1, which is thought to start working in the majority of low-mass stars when they reach the bump luminosities on the red giant branch (RGB), cannot lead to an Li flash or a thermal instability, as has been proposed. The abundance levels of 7Li measured in the most extreme Li-rich giants can be reproduced with models including enhanced extra mixing with a diffusion coefficient Dmix~1011 cm2 s-1. We propose that if extra mixing in RGB stars is driven by rotation, then enhanced extra mixing and Li enrichment in some of these stars can be triggered by their spinning up by an external source of angular momentum. As plausible mechanisms of the spinning up, we consider tidal synchronization of a red giant's spin and orbital rotation in a close binary system and engulfment of a massive planet. The most convincing theoretical argument in favor of our hypothesis is a finding that a 10-fold increase of the spin angular velocity of a solar metallicity upper RGB star results in appropriate changes of both extra-mixing depth and rate, exactly as required for efficient Li production. We regard the existence of binary and single RGB stars with rotational velocities approaching ~10% of their equatorial Keplerian velocities, as well as the much larger proportion of Li-rich giants (~50%) among rapidly rotating objects, as the observational support for our hypothesis.},

abstract = {We present stellar evolutionary sequences for asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars in the Magellanic Cloud clusters NGC 1978, NGC 1846, and NGC 419. The new stellar models for the three clusters match the observed effective temperatures on the giant branches, the oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosities, and the AGB-tip luminosities. A major finding is that a large amount of convective overshoot (up to 3 pressure scale heights) is required at the base of the convective envelope during third dredge-up in order to get the correct oxygen-rich to carbon-rich transition luminosity. The stellar evolution sequences are used as input for detailed nucleosynthesis calculations. For NGC 1978 and NGC 1846 we compare our model results to the observationally derived abundances of carbon and oxygen. We find that additional mixing processes (extra mixing) are required to explain the observed abundance patterns. For NGC 1846 we conclude that non-convective extra mixing processes are required on both the red giant branch and the AGB, in agreement with previous studies. For NGC 1978 it is possible to explain the C/O and 12C/13C abundances of both the O-rich and the C-rich AGB stars by assuming that the material in the intershell region contains high abundances of both C and O. This may occur during a thermal pulse when convective overshoot at the inner edge of the flash-driven convective pocket dredges C and O from the core to the intershell. For NGC 419 we provide our predicted model abundance values although there are currently no published observed abundance studies for the AGB stars in this cluster.},

abstract = {[Abbreviated] We have investigated the color-magnitude diagram of Omega Centauri and find that the blue main sequence (bMS) can be reproduced only by models that have a of helium abundance in the range Y=0.35-$0.40. To explain the faint subgiant branch of the reddest stars ("MS-a/RG-a" sequence), isochrones for the observed metallicity ([Fe/H]\approx0.7) appear to require both a high age (~13Gyr) and enhanced CNO abundances ([CNO/Fe]\approx0.9$). Y~0.35 must also be assumed in order to counteract the effects of high CNO on turnoff colors, and thereby to obtain a good fit to the relatively blue turnoff of this stellar population. This suggest a short chemical evolution period of time (<1Gyr) for Omega Cen. Our intermediate-mass (super-)AGB models are able to reproduce the high helium abundances, along with [N/Fe]~2 and substantial O depletions if uncertainties in the treatment of convection are fully taken into account. These abundance features distinguish the bMS stars from the dominant [Fe/H] $\approx1.7$ population. The most massive super-AGB stellar models (M_zams>=6.8M_sun, M_He,core>=1.245M_sun) predict too large N-enhancements, which limits their role in contributing to the extreme populations. We show quantitatively that highly He- and N-enriched AGB ejecta have particularly efficient cooling properties. Based on these results and on the reconstruction of the orbit of Omega Cen with respect to the Milky Way we propose the galactic plane passage gas purging scenario for the chemical evolution of this cluster. Our model addresses the formation and properties of the bMS population (including their central location in the cluster). We follow our model descriptively through four passage events, which could explain not only some key properties of the bMS, but also of the MS-a/RGB-a and the s-enriched stars.},

abstract = {Studies of stellar populations, understood to mean collections of stars with common spatial, kinematic, chemical, and/or age distributions, have been reinvigorated during the past decade by the advent of large-area sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the Two-Micron All Sky Survey, the Radial Velocity Experiment, and others. We review recent analyses of these data that, together with theoretical and modeling advances, are revolutionizing our understanding of the nature of the Milky Way and galaxy formation and evolution in general. The formation of galaxies like the Milky Way was long thought to be a steady process leading to a smooth distribution of stars. However, the abundance of substructure in the multidimensional space of various observables, such as position, kinematics, and metallicity, is now proven beyond doubt and demonstrates the importance of mergers in the growth of galaxies. Unlike smooth models that involve simple components, the new data reviewed here clearly exhibit many irregular structures, such as the Sagittarius dwarf tidal stream and the Virgo and Pisces overdensities in the halo and the Monoceros stream closer to the Galactic plane. These recent developments have made it clear that the Milky Way is a complex and dynamic structure, one that is still being shaped by the merging of neighboring smaller galaxies. We also briefly discuss the next generation of wide-field sky surveys, such as SkyMapper, Panoramic Survey Telescope {\&} Rapid Response System, Global Astrometric Interferometer for Astrophysics, and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope, which will improve measurement precision manyfold and include billions of individual stars. The ultimate goal, development of a coherent and detailed story of the assembly and evolutionary history of the Milky Way and other large spirals like it, now appears well within reach.},

abstract = {We present results for a suite of fourteen three-dimensional, high resolution hydrodynamical simulations of delayed-detonation modelsof Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) explosions. This model suite comprises the first set of three-dimensional SN Ia simulations with detailed isotopic yield information. As such, it may serve as a database for Chandrasekhar-mass delayed-detonation model nucleosynthetic yields and for deriving synthetic observables such as spectra and light curves. We employ a physically motivated, stochastic model based on turbulent velocity fluctuations and fuel density to calculate in situ the deflagration to detonation transition (DDT) probabilities. To obtain different strengths of the deflagration phase and thereby different degrees of pre-expansion, we have chosen a sequence of initial models with 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 100, 150, 200, 300, and 1600 (two different realizations) ignition kernels in a hydrostatic white dwarf with central density of 2.9 x 10^9 gcc, plus in addition one high central density (5.5 x 10^9 gcc), and one low central density (1.0 x 10^9 gcc) rendition of the 100 ignition kernel configuration. For each simulation we determined detailed nucleosynthetic yields by post-processing 10^6 tracer particles with a 384 nuclide reaction network. All delayed detonation models result in explosions unbinding the white dwarf, producing a range of 56Ni masses from 0.32 to 1.11 solar masses. As a general trend, the models predict that the stable neutron-rich iron group isotopes are not found at the lowest velocities, but rather at intermediate velocities (~3,000 - 10,000 km/s) in a shell surrounding a 56Ni-rich core. The models further predict relatively low velocity oxygen and carbon, with typical minimum velocities around 4,000 and 10,000 km/s, respectively.},

These abundances agree well with those found by previous researchers and expand the analysed sample of the cluster. k-means clustering analysis was used to group the stars into four homogeneous groups based upon these abundances. These stars show the expected anticorrelation between [C/Fe] and [N/Fe]. We investigated the distribution of CN-weak/CN-strong stars on the colour-magnitude diagram. Asymptotic giant branch stars, which were selected from their position on the colour-magnitude diagram, were almost all CN weak. This is in contrast to the red giant branch where a large minority were CN strong. The results were also compared with cluster formation and evolution models. Overall, this study shows that statistically significant elemental and evolutionary conclusions can be obtained from lower resolution spectroscopy.},

abstract = {Thermonuclear supernovae result when interaction with a companion reignites nuclear fusion in a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, causing a thermonuclear runaway, a catastrophic gain in pressure, and the disintegration of the whole white dwarf. It is usually thought that fusion is reignited in near-pycnonuclear conditions when the white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar mass. I briefly describe two long-standing problems faced by this scenario, and our suggestion that these supernovae instead result from mergers of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs, including those that produce sub-Chandrasekhar mass remnants. I then turn to possible observational tests, in particular those that test the absence or presence of electron captures during the burning.},

abstract = {Recent studies of white dwarfs in open clusters have provided new constraints on the initial-final mass relationship (IFMR) for main-sequence stars with masses in the range 2.5-6.5Msolar. We re-evaluate the ensemble of data that determines the IFMR and argue that the IFMR can be characterized by a mean IFMR about which there is an intrinsic scatter. We investigate the consequences of the IFMR for the observed mass distribution of field white dwarfs using population synthesis calculations. We show that while a linear IFMR predicts a mass distribution that is in reasonable agreement with the recent results from the Palomar-Green survey, the data are better fitted by an IFMR with some curvature. Our calculations indicate that a significant (~28) percentage of white dwarfs originating from a single star evolution has masses in excess of ~0.8Msolar, obviating the necessity for postulating the existence of a dominant population of high-mass white dwarfs that arise from binary star mergers.},

abstract = {The basic mechanisms responsible for producing winds from cool, late-type stars are still largely unknown. We take inspiration from recent progress in understanding solar wind acceleration to develop a physically motivated model of the time-steady mass loss rates of cool main-sequence stars and evolved giants. This model follows the energy flux of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence from a subsurface convection zone to its eventual dissipation and escape through open magnetic flux tubes. We show how Alfv{\'e}n waves and turbulence can produce winds in either a hot corona or a cool extended chromosphere, and we specify the conditions that determine whether or not coronal heating occurs. These models do not utilize arbitrary normalization factors, but instead predict the mass loss rate directly from a star's fundamental properties. We take account of stellar magnetic activity by extending standard age-activity-rotation indicators to include the evolution of the filling factor of strong photospheric magnetic fields. We compared the predicted mass loss rates with observed values for 47 stars and found significantly better agreement than was obtained from the popular scaling laws of Reimers, Schr{\"o}der, and Cuntz. The algorithm used to compute cool-star mass loss rates is provided as a self-contained and efficient computer code. We anticipate that the results from this kind of model can be incorporated straightforwardly into stellar evolution calculations and population synthesis techniques.},

abstract = {In this paper we follow the Galactic enrichment of three easily observed light n-capture elements: Sr, Y, and Zr. Input stellar yields have been first separated into their respective main and weak s-process components and r-process component. The s-process yields from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of low to intermediate mass are computed, exploring a wide range of efficiencies of the major neutron source, 13C, and covering both disk and halo metallicities. AGB stars have been shown to reproduce the main s-component in the solar system, i.e., the s-process isotopic distribution of all heavy isotopes with atomic mass number A>90, with a minor contribution to the light s-process isotopes up to A~90. The concurrent weak s-process, which accounts for the major fraction of the light s-process isotopes in the solar system and occurs in massive stars by the operation of the 22Ne neutron source, is discussed in detail. Neither the main s- nor the weak s-components are shown to contribute significantly to the neutron-capture element abundances observed in unevolved halo stars. Knowing the s-process distribution at the epoch of the solar system formation, we first employed the r-process residuals method to infer the isotopic distribution of the r-process. We assumed a primary r-process production in the Galaxy from moderately massive Type II supernovae that best reproduces the observational Galactic trend of metallicity versus Eu, an almost pure r-process element. We present a detailed analysis of a large published database of spectroscopic observations of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, and Eu for Galactic stars at various metallicities, showing that the observed trends versus metallicity can be understood in light of a multiplicity of stellar neutron-capture components. Spectroscopic observations of the Sr, Y, and Zr to Ba and Eu abundance ratios versus metallicity provide useful diagnostics of the types of neutron-capture processes forming Sr, Y, and Zr. In particular, the observed [Sr, Y, Zr/Ba, Eu] ratio is clearly not flat at low metallicities, as we would expect if Ba, Eu and Sr, Y, Zr all had the same r-process nucleosynthetic origin. We discuss our chemical evolution predictions, taking into account the interplay between different processes to produce Sr-Y-Zr. Making use of the very r-process-rich and very metal-poor stars like CS 22892-052 and CS 31082-001, we find hints and discuss the possibility of a primary process in low-metallicity massive stars, different from the ``classical s-process'' and from the ``classical r-process'' that we tentatively define LEPP (lighter element primary process). This allows us to revise the estimates of the r-process contributions to the solar Sr, Y, and Zr abundances, as well as of the contribution to the s-only isotopes 86Sr, 87Sr, and 96Mo.},

The calculations include the most recent interior physics and the latest generation of non-grey atmosphere models. We provide mass-age-color-magnitude relationships for both metallicities. The mass-M_V and mass-M_K relations are in excellent agreement with the empirical relations derived observationally. The theoretical color-magnitude diagrams are compared with the sequences of globular clusters (47 Tucanae) and open clusters (NGC2420 and NGC2477) observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Comparison is also made with field star sequences in M_V-(V-I), M_K-(I-K) and M_K-(J-K) diagrams. These comparisons show that the most recent improvements performed in low-mass star atmosphere models yield now reliable stellar models in the near-infrared. These models can be used for metallicity, mass, temperature and luminosity calibrations. Uncertainties still remain, however, in the optical spectral region below T_eff ~ 3700K, where predicted (V-I) colors are too blue by 0.5 mag for a given magnitude. The possible origins for such a discrepancy, most likely a missing source of opacity in the optical and the onset of grain formation are examined in detail.

The low-density peak of this distribution qualitatively reminds of the clustering of the luminosities of Branch-normal SNe Ia.

abstract = {The evolution and explosion of metal-free stars with masses 10-100 M sun are followed, and their nucleosynthetic yields, light curves, and remnant masses determined. Such stars would have been the first to form after the big bang and may have left a distinctive imprint on the composition of the early universe. When the supernova yields are integrated over a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF), the resulting elemental abundance pattern is qualitatively solar, but with marked deficiencies of odd-Z elements with 7 <= Z <= 13. Neglecting the contribution of the neutrino wind from the neutron stars that they form, no appreciable abundances are made for elements heavier than germanium. The computed pattern compares favorably with what has been observed in metal-deficient stars with [Z] <~ -3. The amount of ionizing radiation from this generation of stars is ~2.16 MeV per baryon (4.15 B per M sun; where 1 B = 1 Bethe = 1051 erg) for a Salpeter IMF, and may have played a role in reionizing the universe. Neglecting rotation, most of the stars end their lives as blue supergiants and form supernovae with distinctive light curves resembling SN 1987A, but some produce primary nitrogen due to dredge-up and become red supergiants. These make brighter supernovae like typical Type IIp's. For the lower mass supernovae considered, the distribution of remnant masses clusters around typical modern neutron star masses, but above 20-30 M sun, with the value depending on explosion energy, black holes are copiously formed by fallback, with a maximum hole mass of ~40 M sun. A novel automated fitting algorithm is developed for determining optimal combinations of explosion energy, mixing, and IMF in the large model database to agree with specified data sets. The model is applied to the low-metallicity sample of Cayrel et al. and the two ultra-iron-poor stars HE0107-5240 and HE1327-2326. Best agreement with these very low metallicity stars is achieved with very little mixing, and none of the metal-deficient data sets considered show the need for a high-energy explosion component. In contrast, explosion energies somewhat less than 1.2 B seem to be preferred in most cases.},
