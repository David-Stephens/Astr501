% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}


* Why problem is interesting*

- Zr ratios in pre solar grains from AGB stars show isotopic signatures of material that left the star. 
- This is from envelope and Zr is produced in 13C pocket, then readjusted in the thermal pulse
- Tracer of conditions that were in the star at that time

* what have other people done *

- battino tried varying f and how diffusion happens for effects (couldnt get ratios seen)
- barzyk for xe128 ratio 

* My probelm, the gap! *

- Try a different functionality of diffusion coefficient, hydro leads to this form
- It contains lower diffusion at base of convection zone, less 22Ne reaction, less Zr96

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{1996ApJ...456..902R},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{cyburt:10}.

\section{Methods and Models}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{\MESA Models}
\label{sec:mesa_models} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Only a 2\Msun, $Z=0.02$, stellar evolution model was usedd. This was computed using the \MESA~\citep{mesa} stellar code and taken from the \nugrid NuGrid set1ext, set1.2 models \citep{models}. These models were evolved from the pre-main sequence to a white dwarf. For this work, a singular thermal pulse, the 13th?, was analyzed and a Kippenhahn diagram of this particular thermal pulse can be seen in \Figure{kipp}. 

For these models, the mixing lengths theory \citep{cox}, MLT, is used for the convection zones with a mixing length, $\alphaMLT=1.73$. Overshoot is implemented in \MESA with the formula from \citet{overshoot} and \citet{freytag}:

\begin{equation}
D = D_{0} exp^{-2z/f H_{p0}}
\label{eq:overshoot}
\end{equation} 

Where D$_{0}$ and H$_{p0}$ are taken at the convective boundary. 


\subsection{\zirconium[95] and \iodine[128] Branching}
\label{sec:branching}


\subsection{Diffusion Coefficient Modifications}
\label{sec:diffusion}

\subsection{\mppnp~Post Processing}
\label{sec:mppnp}

\subsection{Neutron Density and Temperature}
\label{sec:neutron}

\section{Results}
Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

  \caption{Within the He intershell region, the \carbon[13] pocket forms and isotopic ratios are set by the \spr~(\Fig{zr_ratio13C}). It is then mixed and diluted in the He-flash pulse driven convection zone where temperatures get high enough to activate \neon[22]($\alpha,n$)\magnesium[25]. This shifts the isotopic ratios to those shown in \Figure{zr_ratioDil}}

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/C13_Zr.png}
  \caption{Within the \carbon[13] pocket there is a significant amount of \zirconium[94] produced but almost no \zirconium[96]. This is due to the low neutron densities not opening the \zirconium[95] branch.}

% Zr ratio after pulse
\begin{figure}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/Pulse_Zr.png}
  \caption{After the \carbon[13] pocket is mixed into the He-flash pulse driven convection zone, the temperatures get high enough for the \neon[22]($\alpha,n$)\magnesium[25] reaction. This provides high enough neutron densities to open the \zirconium[95] branch and boost the \zirconium[96].}

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.
