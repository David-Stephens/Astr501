% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX

% out the following line
%\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{1996ApJ...456..902R},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{cyburt:10}.

\section{Methods, Observations, Simulations etc.}

Normally the next section describes the techniques the authors used.
It is frequently split into subsections, such as Section~\ref{sec:maths} below.

\subsection{Maths}
\label{sec:maths} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

Simple mathematics can be inserted into the flow of the text e.g. $2\times3=6$
or $v=220$\,km\,s$^{-1}$, but more complicated expressions should be entered
as a numbered equation:

\begin{equation}
    x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.
	\label{eq:quadratic}
\end{equation}

Refer back to them as e.g. equation~(\ref{eq:quadratic}).

\subsection{Figures and tables}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

An example figure can be seen in \Fig{mass-N14}.
, and tables as
e.g. \Tab{example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
  % To include a figure from a file named example.*
  % Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
  % or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex

  %\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/figure_template/mass-N14}
  \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each
    figure.  Give enough detail for the reader to understand what
    they're looking at, but leave detailed discussion to the main body
    of the text.  This particular figure file will appear when you
    exectute the example notebook in
    \texttt{figs/figure\_template}. Then uncomment the
    \texttt{includegraphics} command in the latex source file.} 
    \lFig{mass-N14}
\end{figure}

Another results is also good \Fig{mass-O16}.
% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\lTab{example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figs/figure_template/mass-O16}
    \caption{Another figure.}
    \lFig{mass-O16}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

The Acknowledgements section is not numbered. Here you can thank helpful
colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
Try to keep it short.
